# TORCH

TORCH is a free and open source project i'm doing in my free time.
It's a simple warehouse management software made in python, javascript and HTML.
Multilanguage (for now only Italian and English), can be easily translated trought .txt files in languages directory.
You can run a simple Flask test server directly with python or deploy it in a server (like Apache).

# WARNING

As the project meant to be a "free time project", I do not give any type of fast assistance!
